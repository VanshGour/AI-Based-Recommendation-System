# AI-Based-Recommendation-System

The objective of Task 4 is to design and implement an AI-based recommendation system using Java and popular machine learning libraries such as Apache Mahout. This task focuses on developing a software solution that can analyze user preferences and provide intelligent suggestions, such as products, movies, or content, based on previous interactions. Recommendation systems are widely used in platforms like Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube to enhance user experience by delivering personalized content.

A recommendation system works by analyzing historical data and identifying patterns that suggest what a user might be interested in. There are two primary types of recommendation systems: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Collaborative filtering is based on user behavior, where recommendations are made based on similarities between users or items. Content-based filtering, on the other hand, uses item features to recommend items similar to what the user liked in the past.

For this project, Apache Mahout provides a high-performance and scalable machine learning library that can be easily integrated with Java applications. It supports both item-based and user-based collaborative filtering, making it an ideal choice for implementing recommendation systems.

In this task, the intern is expected to build a basic recommendation engine using a sample dataset. The dataset can include user ratings for products, movies, or other entities. The Java program will process this data and use Mahout’s algorithms to generate personalized suggestions for each user. For instance, if a user has rated several action movies highly, the system should be able to recommend other action movies they haven’t seen yet.

The system will consist of the following components:

Data Model: This component loads and stores user-item rating data, usually from a CSV file or database.

Similarity Measure: Determines how similar users or items are to each other. Apache Mahout supports several similarity metrics like Pearson correlation and cosine similarity.

Recommendation Engine: Uses the similarity measures to find neighbors (similar users or items) and generate recommendations.

Output Module: Displays or saves the recommended items for each user.

The deliverable for this task is a Java program that includes a functioning recommendation engine and uses a sample dataset for demonstration. The code should be well-documented and easy to understand, making it reusable and extensible for future improvements, such as adding new users, updating ratings, or switching between collaborative and content-based filtering.

Through this task, the intern gains hands-on experience in artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts, particularly in building intelligent systems that adapt to user behavior. This knowledge is highly valuable in modern software development, where personalized user experiences are increasingly important.

By completing this task, interns also learn how to integrate external libraries into Java applications, manage data files, and build modular software systems. Furthermore, they acquire practical skills in analyzing data, applying algorithms, and optimizing recommendations for better performance and accuracy.

In summary, Task 4 is a practical and insightful project that introduces interns to AI-driven development. It provides foundational knowledge in recommendation systems and prepares them for advanced applications in e-commerce, media streaming, and other domains where personalization is key.
